<h1 id="swim-003345">SWIM 00:33:45</h1>

<p>🏊 Swim - even fastest ever - I am still sucking with navigation - done extra 150 meters.</p>

<p>Then… Almost 9 minutes spend in T1 because I have forgoten to take race number from the blue bag. When I returned nobody from volounters was able to find my bag, because they placed it in wrong place. 😤😤😤 So angry. In first place for myself ofc.</p>

<h1 id="bike-031449">BIKE 03:14:49</h1>

<p>🚴 Not sure if my Bike split was optimal.</p>

<p>Maybe I could push a bit less, and have more power for 🏃. Anyway some 1350 meters of elevation gain on 90 kilometers path was a challange.</p>

<h1 id="run-015858">RUN 01:58:58</h1>

<p>I feel totaly without power on run.</p>

<p>🍴And I fail with feeding myself powergel + cola + banana == twice 💩💩 on run.</p>

<p>First time ever needed it on race!</p>

<p>How cool that I bought myself two parts trisuit, so this activity did not take so much time 😂 😬😬</p>

<h1 id="overall-060031">OVERALL: 06:00:31</h1>

<p>So many things went wrong. But I am still learning.</p>

<p>First triathlon season so I feel a bit justified.</p>

<p>Anyway finished one the toughest 70.3 events in the world ☺️</p>
