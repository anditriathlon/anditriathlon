SWIM 00:33:45
=============

🏊 Swim - even fastest ever - I am still sucking with navigation - done extra 150 meters. 

Then... Almost 9 minutes spend in T1 because I have forgoten to take race number from the blue bag. When I returned nobody from volounters was able to find my bag, because they placed it in wrong place. 😤😤😤 So angry. In first place for myself ofc.

BIKE 03:14:49
=============

🚴 Not sure if my Bike split was optimal. 

Maybe I could push a bit less, and have more power for 🏃. Anyway some 1350 meters of elevation gain on 90 kilometers path was a challange.

RUN 01:58:58
============

I feel totaly without power on run. 

🍴And I fail with feeding myself powergel + cola + banana == twice 💩💩 on run. 

First time ever needed it on race! 

How cool that I bought myself two parts trisuit, so this activity did not take so much time 😂 😬😬

OVERALL: 06:00:31
=================

So many things went wrong. But I am still learning. 

First triathlon season so I feel a bit justified. 

Anyway finished one the toughest 70.3 events in the world ☺️
